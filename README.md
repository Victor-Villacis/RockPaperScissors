#  Rock Paper Scissors JS Game (Two Tabs Game)

A animation awesome cool drag and drop developer game. Open two tabs to play, so one player does not see the other players move. It is drag and drop. No need to enter names if you don't want to. 

  

I started on this game about 5 years ago. I have never worked on it, I recently came back 3 days ago from today 11/20/20 and decided to make it work. My challenge was making it work for two players in the same browser. I did not want to use any ``Frameworks`` or ``JS Libraries``. I wanted it all to be **Vanilla** JavaScript. 

The game works with two players on the same screen. It is drag and drop. It can be played across different tabs. However, there is a signal that the player who went first went, but there is no signal that the second player went.

  

## Rules

1) Enter Name and decide who goes first.
2) Drag piece into drop Zone. (Don't let player see)
3) Click ready button for second player. 
4) Second player can go. 
5) Click VS button to show winner and start next round. 

### Future Implementations
For sure add React for modulization. Currently the drag and drop is not working on mobile, this needs to addressed. Also add a server with Node.js
Also need to add logic for when game is tied.
